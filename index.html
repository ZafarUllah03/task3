    <h2><u>Limited Overs Career</u></h2>
    <p>After Pakistan's disappointing World Cup campaign, Alam was drafted into a 16-man squad for a One Day
        International series against Sri Lanka in Abu Dhabi. His debut in the 3rd ODI was one to forget, he was caught
        and bowled by Dilhara Fernando for a first ball duck.</p>
    <img src="fw.jpg">
    <p>His second One-day International was a better experience, as he contributed 32 unbeaten runs down the order as
        Pakistan beat India by 31 runs in Jaipur.

        In between those two matches, he travelled to South Africa as part of Pakistan's squad for the 2007 ICC World
        Twenty20 tournament. He played in the semi-final, taking two wickets against New Zealand, one a superb caught
        and bowled effort to dismiss Lou Vincent, as Pakistan progressed to the final, for which he was not selected. In
        Asia Cricket Cup in June 2008, he scored his maiden half century against Hong Kong. In that match, Pakistan's
        top order was ripped by Hong Kong bowlers before Fawad and another team mate Sohail Tanvir set up a 100 runs
        partnership for the 8th wicket. Sohail ended at 59 while Fawad Alam remained unbeaten at 63*. However, he was
        unexpectedly dropped for the Sri Lanka series in January 2009.

        In October 2008, he was selected for the quadrangular Twenty20 International tournament to be played in Canada
        between Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Zimbabwe and hosts Canada In the 4th match of the tournament, he hit 23* from just
        8 balls with 3 sixes and supported the captain Shoaib Malik and guided the team to an exclusive victory by the
        margin of 3 wickets. In that match, he also got the wicket of SHT Kandamby.

        In the very next match against Zimbabwe, he got 3/7 from 3 overs. In that tournament he got 5 wickets and has
        proved to be a handy all-rounder. In the final against Sri Lanka, he was dismissed on just 2 runs but he also
        got 1 wicket in that match.

    </p>
    <h2>2010</h2>
    <p>Alam was picked to play against England in 2010 and wanted to make the most of his opportunity to get picked for
        the two upcoming tours and then be selected for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. He also stated that he had played a
        little bit of club cricket in England to help him get used to the english conditions and to train for the
        tour.[1] Alam scored well in the first two matches but his major break came in the third One-Day International
        when he increased his top score to 64. He then retained his place for the ODI series against South Africa in the
        UAE. After scoring 123 runs in the 5 match series, he was subsequently dropped from the ODI team and later that
        year, lost his place in the T20 team after the tour to New Zealand.

        Back at first-class cricket, he now captains National Bank of Pakistan. Fawad also has been highest run getter
        in first-class season of 2012–13. Alam has been the top rated batsman in domestic cricket for the past couple of
        seasons as per the rankings issued on PCB website.</p>
    <h2>Asia Cup 2014: Fawad's return</h2>
    <p>After being dropped from all formats for three and a half years, his impressive displays domestically (most
        notably being the top run scorer in the President's One Day Trophy in the season 2013/14) earned him a deserved
        recall to the national side for the Asia Cup in 2014. His first match after his recall was against the host team
        Bangladesh, deputising for the injured Sharjeel Khan. He contributed significantly to the team's victory,
        scoring 74 runs from 70 balls in a competitive chase of 326. He continued his form by scoring his maiden
        international ODI hundred (114*) against Sri Lanka in the final, rescuing his side from 18/3 to 260/5 with the
        help of Misbah-ul-Haq and Umar Akmal. His effort was not enough though as Sri Lanka successfully chased the
        target to become the champions of the 2014 Asia Cup.[2]</p>
